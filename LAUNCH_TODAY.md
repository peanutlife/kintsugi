### Step 3: Test the Checklist Yourself (30 minutes)

Before launching, run through it yourself:

1. Open your Zapier account
2. Go through the checklist
3. Find at least 2-3 issues (be honest!)
4. Take screenshots of issues you found
5. Document your results

**Why:**
- You can share real examples in your Reddit post
- You'll understand user experience
- You might find ways to improve the checklist

### Step 4: Create Reddit Post (15 minutes)

1. Copy template from `REDDIT_POST_CHECKLIST.md`
2. Replace `[Link]` with your hosted checklist URL
3. Replace `[Google Form link]` with your email signup
4. Add your real examples from Step 3
5. Save as draft

### Step 5: Launch on Reddit (30 minutes)

**Timing matters!** Best times to post:
- r/nocode: Weekdays 9-11am EST or 6-8pm EST
- r/zapier: Weekdays 10am-2pm EST

**Launch sequence:**

**First:** r/zapier (smaller community, test the waters)
1. Post there first
2. Monitor for 2-3 hours
3. Respond to ALL comments quickly
4. Fix any issues people point out

**Then:** r/nocode (bigger community, main launch)
1. Post 4-6 hours after r/zapier post
2. Use learnings from first post
3. Engage heavily in comments (first 2 hours critical!)

**Pro tips:**
- Respond to comments within 5 minutes for first hour
- Be helpful, not salesy
- Share your own audit results
- Ask questions back ("What did you find?")
